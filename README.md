# Port Forward Me

This is small cli tool to start port forwarding and open up provided port for both router and firewall.

Currently only supports TCP and UDP for protocols and iptables for firewall.

This also requires UPNP is on for your router.

NOTE: Due to firewall access this needs to be ran with `sudo`

### Getting Started

#### Install:

```bash
go install github.com/artrctx/pfm
```

#### Run:

```bash
sudo pfm --port 25565 --protocol tcp --firewall iptables
```

#### Example Output:
